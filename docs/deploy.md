# Deploying CF for K8s

## Prerequisites

You need the following CLIs on your system to be able to run the script:

* [`kapp`](https://k14s.io/#install)
* [`ytt`](https://k14s.io/#install)
* Kubernetes cluster requirements
  * Version 1.14 or higher
  * A minimum of 5 nodes
  * A minimum of 2 CPU, 7.5BGB memory per node

In addition, you will also probably want [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) for your own debugging and inspection of the system.

Make sure that your Kubernetes config (e.g, `~/.kube/config`) is pointing to the cluster you intend to deploy CF for K8s to. This cluster should be on an IaaS that supports load balancer services (e.g., GKE, AKS, etc.).

## Steps to deploy

1. Clone and initialize this git repository:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s.git
   $ cd cf-for-k8s
   ```

1. Create a "CF Installation Values" file and configure it:

   You have the option of auto-generating the installation values or creating the values by yourself.

   #### Option 1 - Generate the install values
   **NOTE:** The script relies on [bosh interpolate](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2-install/#install) to generate the install values
   ```bash
   # expects bosh cli
   $ ./hack/generate-values.sh cf.example.com > /tmp/cf-values.yml
   ```
   #### Option 2 Create the install values
   1. Create a file called `/tmp/cf-values.yml`. You can use `sample-cf-install-values.yml` in this directory as a starting point.
   1. Open the file and change the `system_domain` and `app_domain` to your desired domain address
   1. Generate certificates for the above domains and paste them in `crt`, `key`, `ca` values

   Make sure that your certificates include a subject alternative name entry for the internal `*.cf-system.svc.cluster.local` domain in addition to your chosen external domain.

1. Run the install script with your "CF Install Values" file
   ```bash
   $ ./bin/install-cf.sh /tmp/cf-values.yml
   ```

1. Configure DNS on your IaaS provider to point the wildcard subdomain of your
   system domain and the wildcard subdomain of all apps domains to point to external IP
   of the Istio Ingress Gateway service. You can retrieve the external IP of this service by running
   `kubectl get svc -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].ip}'`
   1. If you used the `./hack/generate-values.sh` script then you should only
      configure a single DNS record for the domain you passed as input to the
      script and have it resolve to the Ingress Gateway's external IP

      e.g.
      ```
      # sample A record in Google cloud DNS. The IP address below is the address of Ingress gateway's external IP
      Domain                  Record Type       TTL         IP Address
      *.<system_domain>	      A	            30	      35.111.111.111
      ```

## Validate the deployment

1. Set up cf cli to point to CF:
   ```bash
   $ cf api --skip-ssl-validation https://api.<system_domain>
   $ CF_ADMIN_PASSWORD=`grep cf_admin_password /tmp/cf-values.yml | yq -r '.cf_admin_password'`
   $ cf auth admin $CF_ADMIN_PASSWORD
   ```

1. Enable docker feature:
   ```bash
   $ cf enable-feature-flag diego_docker
   ```

1. Deploy an app:
   ```bash
   $ cf push diego-docker-app -o cloudfoundry/diego-docker-app
   ```
   Note that the above command will return an error but the app is successfully pushed to CF and is routable via Http. The reason the command fails is due to a missing logging component, which we, the Release Integration, are working with the Logging team to integrate into CF4K8s

1. Validate the app is reachable
   ```bash
   $ curl http://diego-docker-app.<system-domain>/env
   # should return JSON value
   ```
